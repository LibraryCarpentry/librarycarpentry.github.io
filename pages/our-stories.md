### From Individuals  
  
  
**Library Carpentry** by Anton Angelo  
_I had no idea why I was being encouraged to get into librarianship. I was an IT guy working at the University of Otago in Dunedin, with a 10 years of IT training experience, a bit of systems administrations and programming, and facing redundancy. I had been working in the library as the local IT support, and the managers there were all suggesting I should become a librarian. I had all the usual preconceptions of libraries as outdated book museums, but I was (reasonably gently) set right. Libraries are the access point for vast digital collections, with complex and nuanced systems based on all sorts of technologies._
