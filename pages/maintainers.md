excerpt: Maintainers manage lesson amendments and upgrades for our global Carpentries Community.
---

The Carpentries Maintainers work with the community to make sure that lessons stay up-to-date, accurate, functional and cohesive.
Maintainers monitor the individual lesson repositories they manage. Working as a team, they ensure that pull requests and issues are
addressed in a timely manner, and
participate in the lesson development cycle, including lesson releases. They endeavor to be welcoming and supportive of
contributions from all members of the community. This community of practice is a great place to learn to collaborate
effectively in Git and GitHub. Maintainers have their own dedicated Slack channel and
email list.

Maintainers can expect to acquire this [skill set](https://github.com/carpentries/commons/blob/master/text-for-maintainers.md).
