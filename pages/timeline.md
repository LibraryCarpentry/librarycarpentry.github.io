### 2019

Library Carpentry, the Australian Research Data Commons, and the Research Data Alliance Libraries for Research Data Interest Group organised a worldwide sprint with over 20 organisations to develop and publish Top 10 FAIR Data & Software Things to provide domain level guidance on the FAIR principles. The Library Carpentry Maintainer community ran a series of calls to get to know each other, look at what needed to be developed in the lessons, and understand how they wanted to work as groups. The Governance Group transitioned into the Advisory Group which works towards fostering greater participation in the Library Carpentry community. Library Carpentry, LIBER, LIR, and the UCD Library host a Carpentries instructor training workshop for librarians. 5 Library Carpentry lessons part of The Carpentries June 2019 lesson release.
