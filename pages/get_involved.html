<h3>Become a member</h3>  
<p>Libraries are a perfect host for Carpentries activities on campus and can be an invaluable hub for learning data science skills. Departments, labs, and other groups at institutions fall into a cycle of constantly revisiting training programs to keep their communities up-to-date with current software and data tools and approaches. Libraries offer a home for these activities and can help with coordination and integration of computational training within your organization. A variety of membership opportunities exist which a library can subscribe to and grow Carpentries activities at your organization. Read more about <a href="https://carpentries.org/membership/">The Carpentries membership options</a>.  </p>

<p>We’ve gathered a number of <a href="https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/governance/tree/master/proposals">proposals</a> to help with making the case for membership at your organization and there are a number of stories on our <a href="/blog/">blog</a> that can help as well including:</p>

<h3>Read about others’ experiences</h3>
<p>We’ve gathered a number of <a href="/our-stories/">stories</a> from the community so that you can read about others’ experiences. Before you even consider your next steps, learning about what others have done can help.</p>
