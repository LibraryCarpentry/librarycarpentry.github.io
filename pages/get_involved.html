<a name="Attend"></a>
<h3>Attend a workshop</h3>
<p>Browse our <a href="/upcoming_workshops/">Upcoming Library Carpentry Workshops</a> to see if there is an opportunity near you. Also see <a href="https://carpentries.org/upcoming_workshops/">The Carpentries Upcoming Workshops</a> which include workshops from Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry. Sometimes our workshops appear to be only available to organizations but don’t let that stop you. It doesn’t hurt to ask the instructors if there is space available. We often mention upcoming workshops in our various communication channels, but if you are interested in attending a workshop in your area and don’t see one, don’t hesitate to reach out to these communication channels to see if there is an opportunity that hasn’t been announced yet.</p>

<a name="Volunteer"></a>
<h3>Volunteer to help with a workshop</h3>
<p>Instructors always need help. In our workshops, whenever a learner needs help, they place a red sticky on their laptop or raise their hand. Helpers assist learners work through any challenges or questions they may have. If you are familiar with the lesson material being taught, you can reach out to the instructors to see if you can join the workshop and assist. You don’t have to be familiar with all the lesson material, even just one lesson/tool/approach is fine. To find upcoming workshops being held near you, you can browse the <a href="https://carpentries.org/upcoming_workshops/">Upcoming Carpentries Workshops</a> . Alternatively, you don’t necessarily need to be familiar with the material and can inquire with the instructors whether you can observe a workshop instead.</p>

<a name="Host"></a>
<h3>Host a workshop</h3>
<p>Sometimes the best way to understand what a Library Carpentry workshop is like is to host a workshop yourself. Hosting a workshop allows you to see what it takes to organize a workshop, to see the discussions between instructors to determine the appropriate lesson material for your audience, the steps involved in creating a welcoming environment, and more. You can read more about hosting workshops in <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org">The Carpentries Handbook</a>.</p>

<p>If you are considering hosting a workshop, we will work to keep your costs to a minimum. The workshop administration fee is $2,500, and the host site is responsible for instructor travel expenses. We suggest that you estimate $2,500 for the travel, food and accommodations of two instructors, however, we will work to find instructors as local as possible to reduce travel costs. Our <a href="https://carpentries.org/instructors">network of instructors</a> is increasing and more instructors from the overall Carpentries will be able to teach Library Carpentry as we integrate our instructor training material. It is important to note that you must have at least one certified volunteer instructor leading your workshop for it to be listed as an official Library Carpentry and Carpentries workshop. Additional costs to consider include the workshop space and catering. Regarding other resources, laptops and/or desktop computers are often needed as well as helpers from your local community that are familiar with the tools and approaches you will cover in your workshop. Some hosts use Eventbrite to minimize costs and ask for registration. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index.html">Teaching and Hosting</a> section of The Carpentries Handbook.</p>

<a name="Become"></a>
<h3>Become a member</h3>  
<p>Libraries are a perfect host for Carpentries activities on campus and can be an invaluable hub for learning data science skills. Departments, labs, and other groups at institutions fall into a cycle of constantly revisiting training programs to keep their communities up-to-date with current software and data tools and approaches. Libraries offer a home for these activities and can help with coordination and integration of computational training within your organization. A variety of membership opportunities exist which a library can subscribe to and grow Carpentries activities at your organization. Read more about <a href="https://carpentries.org/membership/">The Carpentries membership options</a>.  </p>

<p>We’ve gathered a number of <a href="https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/governance/tree/master/proposals">proposals</a> to help with making the case for membership at your organization and there are a number of stories on our <a href="/blog/">blog</a> that can help as well including:</p>

    <li>Help mentor others joining the community</li>
    <li>Explore new strategic directions for the community</li>

<h3>Read about others’ experiences</h3>
<p>We’ve gathered a number of <a href="/our-stories/">stories</a> from the community so that you can read about others’ experiences. Before you even consider your next steps, learning about what others have done can help.</p>
