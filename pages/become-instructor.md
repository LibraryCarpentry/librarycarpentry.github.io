The Carpentries workshops are taught by trained, peer, volunteer 
instructors. All of our Instructors complete an Instructor 
Training program, which teaches instructional pedagogy as well as the 
practicalities of teaching a Carpentries workshop.

Instructors can teach workshops in their local area or travel to
teach. We've held workshops in over 40 countries on every continent 
(including Antarctica). We match our Instructors with teaching 
opportunities that fit their schedules, travel interests, and 
availability.

There are two steps to becoming an Instructor.  

1. **Take the Instructor Training course**   
The training course runs over two full days and covers the basics of educational psychology, instructional design, and how to apply both to teaching workshops for The Carpentries. To see what our curriculum covers, visit the [instructor training course page](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/).

2. **Complete the checkout process**  
You must complete three short tasks after the course in order to complete certification. These tasks are described in detail [here](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/) and take a total of approximately 8-10 hours. Once you've read the detailed instructions, please use our [simplified checklist](http://www.datacarpentry.org/checkout/) to keep track of your progress.

We are interested in instructors from all domains of research, and are particularly
working to grow our instructor pool in areas where we are developing [new curricula](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/#workshop-materials-under-development-or-consideration).
