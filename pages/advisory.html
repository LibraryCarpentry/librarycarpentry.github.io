<h2>Library Carpentry Advisory Group</h2>

<p>The Library Carpentry Advisory Group acts as a key friend to Carpentries governance and staff and advises on ways to foster greater participation in the Library Carpentry community. The Advisory Group discusses, plans, and pursues strategies for involving new and current members in Library Carpentry. Members of the Group volunteer to serve three year terms, with increasing levels of responsibility and leadership each year.</p>

<p>The Advisory Group was preceded by a <a href="/team/">Steering Group</a> with a remit of guiding Library Carpentry through the merger process with The Carpentries, a task which was completed in 2019.</p>

<h4>2021-2022 Goals:</h4>
The 2021-2022 goals for the LCAG focus on governance and curriculum development. Achieving these goals will help the LCAG in succession planning, and develop expertise in recommending training resources to the Library Carpentry community. Use the issue links to follow progress.
