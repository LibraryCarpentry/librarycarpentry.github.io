<h2>Library Carpentry Advisory Group</h2>

<p>The Library Carpentry Advisory Group acts as a key friend to Carpentries governance and staff and advises on ways to foster greater participation in the Library Carpentry community. The Advisory Group discusses, plans, and pursues strategies for involving new and current members in Library Carpentry. Members of the Group volunteer to serve three year terms, with increasing levels of responsibility and leadership each year.</p>

<p>The Advisory Group was preceded by a <a href="/team/">Steering Group</a> with a remit of guiding Library Carpentry through the merger process with The Carpentries, a task which was completed in 2019.</p>

<h4>2019-2020 Goals:</h4>
The following list of goals is a prioritised list, voted on by all members of the Advisory Group and refined by the chair and coordinator into actionable goals (in July 2019). Advisory Group members will work on moving these goals forward from 2019-2021. <em>Note: Advisory Group and Curriculum Advisory Committee occasional posts discussions and decisions in the <a href="https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/governance">governance repository</a>.</em>
