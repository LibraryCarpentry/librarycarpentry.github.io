This page includes upcoming workshops and previous workshops, sorted by upcoming workshops. Most are first advertised to the organization running the workshop, but some are open to other participants. Don't see a workshop in your area, but wish there was one? Become a host and <a href=../workshops/>request a workshop!</a>

<br /><br /> 
  
If you would like to make an inquiry, request a workshop, or register a self-organised workshop, visit <a href="https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/workshop/">The Carpentries worskhop form</a>. Please note, we are updating our workshop workflow (see [Introducing updated Workshop Request Forms and More](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/09/Workshop-request-forms-and-more/)). In the interim, if you use the form and do not see your workshop listed here, please contact <a href="mailto:team@carpentries.org">team@carpentries.org</a> and/or submit a pull request to our <a href="https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/librarycarpentry.github.io/blob/master/_data/workshops.yml">workshops.yml</a> file.
