Library Carpentry was an exploratory programme of four three-hour software skills sessions focused on the needs and requirements of the library professionals. For further details, see the [outline post](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/outline/). Sessions were held on Monday the 9th, 16th, 23th, and 30th of November 2015 at City University London. We thank the [Centre for Information Science](https://www.city.ac.uk/department-library-information-science/centre-for-information-science) for generously agreeing to host Library Carpentry.

Library Carpentry is far from over, but we now into a phase of reflection and planning. If you are interested in what happened during this exploratory run, I direct your attention to two blog posts:

- James Baker, '[Library Carpentry in words and numbers: all code, no woodwork](http://cradledincaricature.com/2015/12/01/library-carpentry-in-words-and-numbers-all-code-no-woodwork/)' (1 December 2015)
- Clare Playforth, '[Why the information profession needs Library Carpentry](http://software.ac.uk/blog/2015-12-03-why-information-profession-needs-library-carpentry-0)' (3 December 2015)

Library Carpentry is funded by the [Software Sustainability Institute](http://software.ac.uk/). The Software Sustainability Institute cultivates world-class research with software. The Institute is based at the universities of Edinburgh, Manchester, Southampton and Oxford.
