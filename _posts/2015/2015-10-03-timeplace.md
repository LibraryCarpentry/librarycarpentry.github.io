Library Carpentry is an exploratory programme of four three-hour software skills sessions focused on the needs and requirements of the library professionals. For further details, see the [outline post](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/outline/).

Library Carpentry sessions will be held on Monday the 9th, 16th, 23th, and 30th of November 2015. Sessions will start at 1730 and conclude by 2030. They will be held at City University London in room C304 (Tait Building, third floor, room 4). Directions are available on the [City website](http://www.city.ac.uk/visit#9605=1). We thank the [Centre for Information Science](https://www.city.ac.uk/department-library-information-science/centre-for-information-science) for generously agreeing to host Library Carpentry.

Library Carpentry is funded by the [Software Sustainability Institute](http://software.ac.uk/). The Software Sustainability Institute cultivates world-class research with software. The Institute is based at the universities of Edinburgh, Manchester, Southampton and Oxford.
