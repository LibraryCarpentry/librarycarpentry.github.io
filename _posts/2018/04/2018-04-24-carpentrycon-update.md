[CarpentryCon 2018](http://www.carpentrycon.org/) in Dublin is little more than a month away! This inaugural community-building 
and networking event for the Carpentries should be a major highlight
of the year, with a great [program](http://www.carpentrycon.org/#prog) of speakers and workshops to keep people engaged. 
CarpentryCon will run from 30 May to 1 June, 2018.

To help people get excited about what is coming, the Task Force are running a daily Twitter countdown 
through the [dedicated CarpentryCon feed](https://twitter.com/carpentrycon). 

[Malvika Sharan](https://twitter.com/MalvikaSharan/), a leading member of 
the [CarpentryCon Task Force](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon) has produced a new poster 
for CarpentryCon 2018. It lists our keynote speakers and provides a ton of useful information.
