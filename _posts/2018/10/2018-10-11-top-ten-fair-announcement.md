## Announcing the Top 10 FAIR Data Things Global Sprint  

Join us on 29-30 November 2018, for the Top 10 FAIR Data Things Global Sprint! The Sprint is being organised by 
[Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/), [Australian Research Data Commons](https://ardc.edu.au/) and the 
Research Data Alliance [Libraries for Research Data Interest Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/libraries-research-data.html) 
in collaboration with [FOSTER Open Science](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/), [OpenAire](https://www.openaire.eu/), 
[RDA Europe](https://www.rd-alliance.org/rda-europe), [Data Management Training Clearinghouse](http://dmtclearinghouse.esipfed.org/), 
[California Digital Library](https://www.cdlib.org/), [Dryad](http://datadryad.org/), [AARNet](https://www.aarnet.edu.au/), [Center for Digital Scholarship at the Leiden University](https://www.library.universiteitleiden.nl/research-and-publishing/centre-for-digital-scholarship), and [DANS](https://dans.knaw.nl/nl).  

## The Goal of the Sprint  

We are using this Sprint to develop Top 10 FAIR Data Things resources by research disciplines and/or themes. 
Weâ€™ve created the following primer (instructions) to help you plan and develop your resources:  

[Top 10 FAIR Data Things Sprint Primer (Instructions)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TwJyButvAVEz5tCq_bdzD6kdKMvy0wiVLuE3uNbR7Bs/edit?usp=sharing)  

The objective is to create brief guides (stand alone, self paced training materials) that can be used by the 
research community to understand FAIR in different contexts as well as some initial steps to consider.

We are also planning an introductory webinar in mid November, where you can familiarize yourself with the topic of 
FAIR data, the 10 things, and how the Sprint will work. Information about the webinar and how to register will be released 
shortly.  

## How to Join the Sprint  

Anyone in the world can contribute, from researchers to librarians, and anyone else who works with research data or 
provides research data support.  

### Step 1  

Reach out to colleagues in the research community who you would like to team up with to create the resource. Or, you can 
use the registration table to express your interest in working on a discipline/theme.  

### Step 2  

Register yourself and/or your team by listing the discipline/theme you will be working on during the Sprint, your 
site/affiliation, yourself, and others you are working with here:  

[Registration and Coordination - Top 10 FAIR Data Things](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jm--vzQNeU7DJOqlNqoXbRLWhsTdLghDtqH-5tpVVpw/edit?usp=sharing)

You can also add a link to the collaborative doc you will be using during the Sprint if you would like to start working on 
your resource beforehand.

## How the Sprint Will Work   

You can start working straight away on your Top 10 FAIR Data Things resource. There will be designated people available to 
answer questions at most times during the Sprint. We will use the [Library Carpentry Gitter Top 10 FAIR chat room](https://gitter.im/LibraryCarpentry/Top10FAIR) to wrangle those questions and clarifications. Join the chat room at any time using your GitHub username or your Twitter handle. 

During the Sprint, you will be able to ask questions via scheduled Zoom video conference calls (join via [https://monash.zoom.us/j/944903353](https://monash.zoom.us/j/944903353)) which we will also use for coordination and networking. If you are not sure about something, please post a question in the chat room (directed to someone in particular, if need be) and someone will get back to you.

## How the Sprint Will Be Organised  

* Registered sprinters start working at different times around the world. Individuals and groups will organise their own 
work and report back on how things are going during Zoom video conference calls, via the chat room, or through the daily 
handovers (where the baton will be passed on to the next locations). 
* Handovers will take place at the end of the work day in the southern hemisphere and at the beginning of the new work day 
there.
* Sprinters can work on whatever discipline or theme they like for their resources. Ask questions or coordinate with 
others in the chat room and/or via Zoom.
* Dedicated Google docs will be created for each resource being worked on - they will be listed on the 
registration and coordination doc once the Sprint is underway. We will be using the [Top 10 FAIR Data Things Global Sprint folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CYNd_kFnf954aKYGiph_j8gZnqBBi_9P) to organise the resources. 
* Links to video calls will also be posted on the registration and coordination doc, with the scheduled times - all links 
will show the time and date in your zone.
* You can use the Sprint to network. Use the Sprint to meet other people virtually and talk about other opportunities 
and challenges around FAIR.

## At the End of the Sprint  

We will work with sprinters to upload their resources to the [Library Carpentry GitHub repository](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry) 
and also cross post this work via the partners and collaborators communication channels.
