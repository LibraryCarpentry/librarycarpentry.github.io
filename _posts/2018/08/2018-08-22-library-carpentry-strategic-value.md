The [Data Science Community Newsletter](https://cds.nyu.edu/newsletter/), a helpful resource  by Laura Noren and 
Brad Stanger, helps us track all the data science initiatives sweeping through higher ed. Brown, Harvard, NYU, 
Stanford, UC Irvine, UIUC, University of Michigan, and others have launched data science initiatives in the past 
few years and have been announced in each newsletter.

A recent paper titled [Creating Institutional Change in Data Science](http://msdse.org/files/Creating_Institutional_Change.pdf) 
from the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments (MSDSE), NYU, UC Berkeley, and the University of Washington, highlights the 
importance of library services and spaces in driving these initiatives on campuses. “Partnering with our libraries”, 
according to the paper, “has been an important component of these efforts.” The report also notes that libraries’ engagement 
with The Carpentries has strengthened ties with groups on campus.  

As the MSDSE report shows, libraries can serve as the institutional home for data science initiatives within their 
communities. In general, libraries are a natural hub for researchers, citizens, students, programmers: we help bring people 
together to tackle difficult challenges.

In the report, we also see the demonstrated need researchers worldwide have to learn software and data skills. In higher ed, 
departments, labs, student groups all go through the cycle of creating and re-creating local meet-ups and training programs 
to address these needs. 

Thankfully, The Carpentries curriculum and workshop offerings have expanded in recent years to respond to this need for 
data science training. Libraries are partnering with The Carpentries to sustain these training efforts with the help of 
data-savvy librarians and innovative spaces. Libraries at places like 
[University of Oklahoma](https://libraries.ou.edu/content/meet-experts-foundational-coding-and-data-science) are 
realizing the potential of leveraging The Carpentries at scale to bring together researchers from different disciplines, 
foster collaboration, and be a hub for data science activities on their campuses. We also find in a recent [IMLS data 
sciences in libraries report](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/33891/) the recommendation that libraries should start 
partnering with The Carpentries to address the computational skills gap on campuses while also serving as another connection 
point to industry where there is [a need for highly skilled and qualified candidates in data science](https://www.luminafoundation.org/files/resources/investing-in-americas-data-science.pdf).

At the University Libraries at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I see the benefits of partnering with 
The Carpentries. Doing so allows us to spend our time more efficiently through developing training material collaboratively 
at a global scale. This in turn allows librarians to focus on relationships, and teaching a common curriculum that teaches 
computational skills across many disciplines. Software and data skills are now needed in every discipline and, via 
Carpentries training, the Libraries can learn about and implement additional services that can help UNC-Chapel Hill 
researchers excel.  

The University Libraries sees The Carpentries as a strategic way to better aligning our services to the UNC-Chapel Hill 
research community. In October, we will [launch our initiative](https://libcce.github.io/2018-10-18-UNC/) to train a 
significant number of our staff, library school faculty, and students and help them develop as instructors. The idea is 
simple: the Libraries will act as a hub for Carpentries activities on campus and work with our institutional partners to 
integrate the training in a variety of ways. I am excited about Library Carpentry and I anticipate that other libraries 
will equally benefit from The Carpentries efforts.
