Seventy-one Library Carpentry workshops have now been taught around the world, including one-day, two-day, and multi-day events, with future workshops being added every day.

With this milestone behind us, it is important to pause and appreciate what has been achieved so far by the community. Since 2015, more than 102 instructors and 123 helpers, 225 in total, have contributed to Library Carpentry training events in 13 countries. We have collaboratively developed open educational lessons to teach software and data skills for anyone who works in libraries or similar organisations.

Thanks to their contributions, we’ve helped well over a thousand learners by covering a range of topics, from Introduction to Data to Open Refine ([see the full list of lessons](https://librarycarpentry.org/#portfolio)). Fourteen lesson maintainers keep the lessons running smoothly and make sure that they conform to the Carpentries' pedagogical model. In addition, we have had three highly successful sprints that featured a global set of lesson developers working to add to and improve Library Carpentry lesson materials (more on the sprints below). 

There is still much more event data that we can capture from our community! If you see anything that is missing, please contribute to the [workshops spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ekCHTBRtTO0vAWIq8YER49ZLwh18PYPGbgJtZ5V9rgw/edit#gid=1110089093) and/or reach out to [chris@carpentries.org](mailto:chris@carpentries.org). 

### Funding support

Library Carpentry workshops have benefited from the generous support of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk), the [National and State Libraries of Australia](https://www.nsla.org.au/) (NSLA), the [California Digital Library](https://www.cdlib.org/), the [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/), [City University London](https://www.city.ac.uk/), the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/), and [Universities New Zealand](https://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/).

From 2013 to 2015, seven Software Carpentry for librarians workshops were held to respond to growing interest in the library community for Carpentries workshops. This momentum would later inspire Dr James Baker to develop Library Carpentry.

In 2016, the [first Library Carpentry two-day sprint](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/06/library-carpentry-sprint.html) took place as part of the Mozilla Science Lab's global sprint (or #mozsprint). Around twenty people from six countries collaborated over two days to improve and extend lessons and begin to build a global community.

In 2017, the second Library Carpentry sprint (also part of #mozsprint) attracted 105 people from seven countries to work on upgrading and creating lessons. With more than 800 'events' (issues and pull requests) across our repositories over the two days, our work comprised a fifth of all work done in that year's mozsprint. 2018 was also the year when an instructor training targeted at library professionals was run after [csv,conf](https://csvconf.com/) in Portland, Oregon. 

In 2018, the third Library Carpentry Sprint generated 3,138 views of the repositories during the sprint, with 341 unique visitors. More than 150 pull requests and issues were raised against the lessons, with the `git` and `sql` lessons getting some much-needed attention. A second instructor training geared towards librarians is planned for late August this year. 

Thanks to community involvement in developing the lessons and more instructors coming on board, workshop numbers are on the rise. With the [appointment of Chris Erdmann](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/04/announce-ce-lc-hire/) as the Library Carpentry Community and Development Director, this will continue. Chris aims to inspire further community growth, instructor onboarding, lesson development, and to help with logistics during Library Carpentry’s 'incubation' as a fully fledged Carpentry.

### Growing the instructor pool

A dedicated Carpentries instructor training for libraries will be run in Calgary from 30-31 August. 
[Read more](https://librarycarpentry.org/blog/2018/06/library-carpentry-inst-training/). This will help grow the community of instructors to allow Library Carpentry to respond to more requests for workshops.

### What has been taught

OpeRefine, Unix Shell, regular expressions, Python, Git - these are the Library Carpentry lessons that have been taught the most. Instructors value flexibility and SQL, Tidy Data, Web Scraping, and Data Intro for Archivists have also found their way into instruction, but far less than the more popular lessons.

### In the beginning

Library Carpentry was the brainchild of [Dr. James Baker](https://twitter.com/j_w_baker), (then at the British Library, now at the University of Sussex), who came up with the idea of adapting Software Carpentry lessons and teaching methods to help librarians develop digital skills (based on the popularity of earlier Software Carpentry workshops for librarians run at Harvard University, University Toronto, Edmonton Public Library, New York Public Library, and West Vancouver Memorial Library). Along with Daniel van Strien and Owen Stephens, James ran the first Library Carpentry workshop in London in November 2015. The course was taught in four evening sessions over four weeks, and James's work on this was supported by a fellowship with the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk/). 

In 2016, Library Carpentry won the British Library Labs Teaching and Learning Award.

### A Big Thank You

We would like to thank the following people who have contributed to this amazing outcome. If you have been a helper, instructor, or maintainer, and don’t see your name here, we apologise. Please let us know by [adding your workshop information to the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ekCHTBRtTO0vAWIq8YER49ZLwh18PYPGbgJtZ5V9rgw/edit#gid=1110089093 ) or by contacting [chris@carpentries.org](mailto:chris@carpentries.org) so you can be added to our records.

We would also like to encourage the community to keep up the good work, continue to contribute to lesson development, running workshops, and spreading the word about Library Carpentry!
