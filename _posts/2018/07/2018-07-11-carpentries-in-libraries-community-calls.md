## Time to talk about data and software skills in libraries

One of the strengths of The Carpentries is its community and libraries are great places to foster conversations around data and software skills. There are a number of places where our community can have conversations and get involved - these include our Library Carpentry [GitHub](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry), [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/LibraryCarpentry/Lobby), and [Topicbox list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss-library-carpentry). Now there is another option. Starting in August, we will start a monthly online calls series for one hour with the following format:

* 0-20 min - Guest speaker
* 20-50 min - Community updates
* 50-60 min - Library Carpentry updates

For the calls, we will use a [collaborative etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/lc-community-calls). Members of the community can participate by adding their names, contact information, and updates under the “Community Updates” sections. The next 3 calls are listed in the etherpad, details on how to join the calls via Zoom are listed, and we already have speakers lined up to inspire discussions around topics:

We hope to collect community feedback on whether these calls are useful in the next few months.
