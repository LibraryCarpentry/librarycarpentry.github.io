Recently, I was lucky to participate in an innovative workshop held at [Technische Informationsbibliothek 
(TIB)](https://www.tib.eu/en/) Hannover from 9 - 13 July, 2018, which paired The Carpentries’ pedagogical 
style of teaching and lesson material with in-depth background on the FAIR Data Principles. FAIR comprises a 
set of guiding principles to make data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable 
([Wilkinson _et al._, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18)). FAIR is a relatively new initiative 
that is gaining momentum. Key stakeholders across the research lifecycle are exploring how the underlying 
FAIR Principles can be applied and assessed at various points. For instance, at the [2018 Research Data Alliance (RDA) 
Plenary Meeting in Berlin](https://www.rd-alliance.org/plenaries/rda-eleventh-plenary-meeting-berlin-germany), 
FAIR was mentioned in at least 23 of the sessions:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was struck by how often FAIR was mentioned at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RDAplenary?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RDAplenary</a> so added up. It&#39;s mentioned in no less than 23 of the session descriptions, covering topics as diverse as aircraft systems data, agriculture, costs and ethics. Amazing a policy initiative has such broad uptake so quickly</p>&mdash; Sarah Jones (@sjDCC) <a href="https://twitter.com/sjDCC/status/979260449303814144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2018</a>

Researchers are already starting to ask, _How can my research be more FAIR?_ Thanks to 
[Angelina Kraft](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/non-textual-materials/focus-of-work/research-data/) 
(team lead, research data and scientific software) and 
[Katrin Leinweber](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/non-textual-materials/focus-of-work/scientific-software/) 
(research assistant) at TIB Hannover, we have a headstart on developing a training program for the research community on 
FAIR Data and Software. Angelina and Katrin were joined by Carpentries instructors 
[Konrad Foerstner](https://twitter.com/konradfoerstner) (ZB MED - Informationszentrum Lebenswissenschaften), 
[Martin Hammitzsch](https://twitter.com/mrtnhmtz) (Das Helmholtz-Zentrum Potsdam Deutsches GeoForschungsZentrum), 
[Luke Johnston](https://twitter.com/lwjohnst) (Aarhus University), and [Mateusz Kuzak](https://twitter.com/matkuzak) 
(Dutch Techcentre for Life Sciences) in contributing to the workshop lesson materials and notes. These  can be 
found at the [workshop website](https://tibhannover.github.io/2018-07-09-FAIR-Data-and-Software/) while the slides can be 
viewed at the [2018-07-09-FAIR-Data-and-Software-TIB-workshop Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JO-0SjKw52ICbNSHZuqdXjdIZIrh3Alp) 
(or [as PDFs](https://tib.eu/cloud/s/tXSt3j7Bg3ySdXY)). All the materials are openly shared in the hopes that others will 
reuse and develop them further. Video recordings will also be available at the [TIB AV-Portal](https://av.tib.eu/). In 
addition, I and other participants tweeted non-stop to document the workshop for others following along remotely via the 
hashtag [#TIBFDS](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23TIBFDS&src=typd).

Katrin (left) and Angelina (pictured above) demonstrated that you can successfully pair background information on the 
FAIR Principles with the hands-on examples taught in The Carpentries. For others hoping to better prepare for FAIR and 
train their communities in the principles, the TIB Hannover workshop serves as an excellent starting point. I know a 
number of us in Library Carpentry will be working with Angelina and Katrin to further develop their material.
