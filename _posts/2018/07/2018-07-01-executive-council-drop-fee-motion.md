To bring Software and Data Carpentry self-organized workshop fees into agreement with one another, the 2018 Executive Council passed a motion to eliminate the $500 fee for self-organized Data Carpentry workshops.

# Why eliminate the self-organized workshop fee?

Until 2018, Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry operated side-by-side but independently, each with their own governing bodies and executive directors. While the two organizations shared some processes and staff, decisions about things like workshop fees were made independently. Along with the 2018 merger came a need to unify and streamline operations. Data Carpentry required a $500 fee, while Software Carpentry required no fee for self-organized workshop. Removing the $500 fee will not impact finances much, so to bring fees into alignment we moved to eliminate the $500 fee altogether.

# How is a self-organized workshop different from a centrally-organized one?
The fee for workshops centrally organized by Carpentries staff remains the same at $2500 USD. Carpentries staff take care of finding instructors to teach the workshop, help to finalize dates and curriculum, and set up a workshop web site and registration. Those who choose to self-organize must take care of these important details themselves.

# What is the impact of self-organized workshop fee removal?

While workshop fees are an important source of revenue for the Carpentries, most of this income is generated when Carpentries staff organize and administer workshops rather than when workshop hosts do so. Removal of the $500 self-organized workshop fee will have minimal impact on Carpentries finances, and will foster more workshops in places that lack the resources to pay fees. By removing the fee we hope to see more workshops organized by groups of people who have the passion and commitment to run workshops, but not the funds to do so. This one small decision will help to grow and spread local Carpentries communities, and will help us live up to our tagline to teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide.
