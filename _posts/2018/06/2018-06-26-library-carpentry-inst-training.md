We are pleased to announce an open Carpentries instructor training course on **30-31 August** geared specifically 
for the [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/) movement supported by a grant to the California Digital 
Library from the IMLS.

## Open call for instructor training 

This course will take place in Calgary, Alberta, Canada at the [University of Calgary Libraries](https://library.ucalgary.ca/). 
The two-day course is open to anyone and the event will focus on preparing members of the library community as 
Carpentries instructors. The sessions will be led by Carpentries staff and community members, 
[Karen Word](https://twitter.com/karen_word), [Juliane Schneider](https://twitter.com/JulianeS), 
and [Chris Erdmann](https://twitter.com/libcce).

## What is Library Carpentry?

For those who don’t know, Library Carpentry is a global community of library professionals who are developing 
Carpentries-style lessons to train the library community in software and data skills. 

There are a number of ways to [get in touch with us](https://librarycarpentry.org/#contact) starting with our 
Twitter account [@libcarpentry](https://twitter.com/libcarpentry).

Library Carpentry is actively creating training modules for librarians and holding workshops around the world. 
It’s a relatively new movement that has received support from two IMLS grants, 
[Shifting to Data Savvy](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/33891/) and 
[Expanding Library Carpentry](https://www.imls.gov/sites/default/files/grants/re-85-17-0121-17/proposals/re-85-17-0121-17-full-proposal-documents.pdf). You can learn more about it by reading: [Library Carpentry: software skills training for library professionals](https://www.liberquarterly.eu/articles/10.18352/lq.10176/). 

## Why should you get certified as a Carpentries Instructor? 

Library Carpentry is a movement tightly coupled with The Carpentries, a project that comprises 
the Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry lesson projects. Since all are based on a train-the-trainer model, 
one of our challenges has been how to get more experience as instructors. This issue is handled within 
The Carpentries by requiring instructor certification. Although certification is not a requirement for 
involvement in Library Carpentry, doing so will help us refine workshops, teaching modules, and grow the movement. 
Also, by getting certified, you can start hosting your own Library Carpentry, Software Carpentry, or 
Data Carpentry events on your own campus or within your own organisation. It’s a great way to engage with your 
campuses and library community! 

## Prerequisites 

Applicants will learn how to teach people the skills and perspectives required to work more effectively with 
data and software. The focus will be on evidence-based education techniques and hands-on practice; as a condition 
of taking part, applicants must agree to:

- Agree to teach at a Library Carpentry workshop within 12 months of completing the course, and
