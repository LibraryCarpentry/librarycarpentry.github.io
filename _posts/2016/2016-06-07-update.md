Last week a global team of volunteers spent two days improving and enriching the original Library Carpentry materials. Belinda Weaver describes this AMAZING effort in a [blog post](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/06/LibrarCarpentrysprint.html).

The upshot of this is that the original materials have been superseded. To find the latest Library Carpentry lessons, please now head to [https://github.com/data-lessons](https://github.com/data-lessons) where the community will continue to update, maintain, and improve the lesson materials as they as used and reused across the globe!

Library Carpentry was funded by the [Software Sustainability Institute](http://software.ac.uk/). The Software Sustainability Institute cultivates world-class research with software. The Institute is based at the universities of Edinburgh, Manchester, Southampton and Oxford.
