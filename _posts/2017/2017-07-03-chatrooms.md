After the massive success of the [2017 global sprint](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/06/lc-sprint.html), the Library 
Carpentry community decided it was time for create new chatrooms to handle the increasing volume of posts.

There are now three rooms - the [Lobby](https://gitter.im/LibraryCarpentry/Lobby) which is a bit of a social, 'meet-and-greet' 
kind of place; [lesson-dev](https://gitter.im/LibraryCarpentry/lesson-dev) for discussing lesson ideas, planning and maintenance;
and a third room, [workshops](https://gitter.im/LibraryCarpentry/lesson-dev), for questions, discussions and debriefs about workshops past 
and upcoming.

Instructions have been posted in the old chatroom about how to join the new one. 

As before, anyone can join any or all of the chatrooms with their GitHub or Twitter credentials.

We look forward to welcoming you to our new rooms.
